1. Record yourself using your webcam into mp4
2. Use ffmpeg to convert the mp4 to mjpeg format:
    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 livenessCheck.mjpeg
3. Update the name of video file to use inside WebDriverFactory.java
4. For local Chrome: Copy the mjpeg file to the resources folder
5. For remote Chrome (Selenoid): Copy the mjpeg file to the mountData folder in the server, currently
   it is under: /home/ubuntu/selenoid/mountData

In order for Selenoid to share the mountData folder with browser containers, make sure the browsers.json
configuration file contains instructions to mount that folder:
    "volumes" : ["/home/ubuntu/selenoid/mountData:/tmp/mountData:ro"]
