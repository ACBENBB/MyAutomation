Important!
As of 09/11/2023 MetaMask has a new security feature which might randomly break the automation with this exception:
    org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptException: javascript error: LavaMoat - property "ret_nodes" of globalThis is inaccessible under scuttling mode. To learn more visit https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/360.
The fix is to disable 'scuttleGlobalThis' by following these guides:

    https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/360
Basically:
    1. Rename metaMask.crx to metaMask.zip
    2. Extract all files
    3. Edit file runtime-lavamoat.js -> line 92 change:
        this:
            {"scuttleGlobalThis":{"enabled":true,
        to this:
            {"scuttleGlobalThis":{"enabled":false,
    4. Zip all files back to metaMask.zip
    5. Rename metaMask.zip to metaMask.crx
